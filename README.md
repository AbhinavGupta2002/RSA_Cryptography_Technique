# RSA_Scheme_Cryptography
This simple project, developed in Dr Racket, is an encryption and decryption system that is based on the RSA cryptography technique. 
Everything is automated - the user only needs to enter the message that he/she wants to encrypt. 
This program can also decipher any message that has been encrypted via the RSA scheme.

The Racket file consists of complete documentation.

This self developed program is under the MIT License.
