# RSA_Scheme_Cryptography
This simple project, developed in Dr Racket, is an encryption and decryption system that is based on the RSA cryptography technique. Everything is automated - the user only needs to enter the message that he/she wants to encrypt. This program can also decipher any message that has been encrypted via the RSA scheme.
The Racket file consists of extensive documentation.
